For proper learning, feedback should be **Specific**, **Actionable,** and **Immediate**. It should also be focused on the task/learning.

Examples of positive feedback are praise and intrinsic satisfaction from succeeding. In addition to further engraving the pattern which elicited the positive feedback, it can improve motivation and confidence.

Negative feedback is usually corrective. Improperly harsh negative feedback (including personal judgments about the learner's abilities) can trigger defensiveness, fear, and stress, which hurts learning significantly.

Proper, constructive feedback clarifies whether an action was correct, explains why it was or wasn't, and either provides the correct answer or guides the learner toward finding it themselves.
