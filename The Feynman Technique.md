Demonstrate understanding of a concept by explaining it in very simple terms, as if to a child or complete novice. In the process, the gaps become evident and what's already known becomes further reinforced. This can be broken down into four steps:
1. Choose a concept: A specific topic or skill is best, it's not feasible to explain a whole field all at once.
2. Explain it simply: This can be done through writing or speaking. It doesn't necessarily require someone to explain it to, although an audience can be helpful.
3. Identify knowledge gaps: Take note of the places where explanations become tangled-up or jargony. Anything that can't be explained simply is probably not really understood.
4. Review, simplify, and refine: Fill in the gaps identified in the previous step, then take the explanation and try to break it down even further.

The Feynman technique is useful as a way to obtain feedback without requiring an expert's assistance. Explaining in simple terms also connects the ideas to those simple terms in the brain, bringing understanding down to a deeper level.
