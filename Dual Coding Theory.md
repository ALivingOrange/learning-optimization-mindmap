A [theory of cognition]() that suggests the brain processes two channels: verbal and visual. It's worth bearing in mind that this has more to do with how the brain parses the information than how it's presented; that is, a vivid description which causes the learner to imagine a scene would stimulate both verbal and visual encoding.

[Some research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09541440244000256) suggests that using both channels at the same time increases information retention. However, [other research](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/99154920/pdf-libre.pdf?1677438637=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DDo_You_Remember_the_Words_Dual_Coding_Me.pdf&Expires=1746734383&Signature=bywmxh9osBHO4TO4GaUzsLcnozicCMVU2oDHgLNWh4zN4WipZ9mnt-VxHz66JFCitg--RcqknOBrtD-w7Rgqw4LYIEBAAGyh9djxsMmxt-QEkVha9nHwB5Gw8gsSMmJBGqc4bi~N4DJfScIfHTsP9KlEC4lgmX6ID66-NIZo4gObhCha6j1cHLB47fsi2OTeUCAMx0KhFy-AMhyt1QypZqbLQ9jGQ7AGOc1XaW5z4Fy12wAuYAx03FWaRROMj29GHJqFAGTNoTDbBk3HG~7BaS5liC9bnP3Zk-C~VSL-bcBnejW~dtfE3U~J~wkEbGSZvRunH3EBUI2VIu~HmusI~A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) with a different experiment showed significant effect on elementary students and no significant effect on university students, suggesting that the degree of effectiveness depends on the task and audience.
