AKA: Distributed practice, distributed/spaced repetition.

Leverages the ["spacing effect," a well-documented psychological phenomenon.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf01320097) The optimal time to review material is right when you're about to forget it. Stimulating the half-forgotten memory conveys to the brain, "Hey, we never know when we'll need this again, better keep it saved." This is much more effective than trying to practice over and over again in one time.

Tools such as [[Flash Cards]] are a great way for spaced practice; making the flashcards in the first place is effective practice on its own, and then reviewing them after enough time has passed reinforces the information. Such methods can also combine spaced practice with [[Active Recall]], further improving the speed of learning.

Practicing spaced repetition can get a learner in tune with their own forgetting cycle, providing a better grasp on how to tell how well they're remembering something and how long it'll take them to forget.
