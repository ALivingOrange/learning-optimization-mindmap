Many tasks, including learning, are made easier by dividing them into more manageable subtasks. 

When decomposing a skill, begin with a clear purpose: a well-defined target capability. Then, break the target down into its components: knowledge/facts, motor skills, mental strategies, etc. Sort them into a reasonable order and then get to work.
