The physical environment can have a significant effect on [[Focus]].

Minimize distractions, have the necessary resources readily accessible. Having reminders of learning goals present can be helpful. You want to decrease the [[Activation Energy]] required to start learning. Keep the study area organized such that everything you need is within reach. Try to keep it quiet, too.

Make sure the environment is comfortable enough for you to not mind staying in it for moderate to long periods of time.
