Motivation can be **intrinsic** or **extrinsic**. 

Motivation and success feed into each other, a positive feedback loop. A success will cause intrinsic motivation to flare, which makes the learner better at learning, making future successes easier. You can set relatively easy goals early on to take advantage of this, snowballing small wins into more motivation and more learning.
