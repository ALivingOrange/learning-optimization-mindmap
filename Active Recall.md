Active recall/retrieval describes practice at actively retrieving information from memory (in contrast to passively reviewing it). [Deliberately trying to remember information requires more work, but it is much better at solidifying information to access in the future.](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0038-1666983)

In addition to the direct benefits to recall, it is also helpful because it gives the opportunity to *fail* at recalling something, indicating an area that needs focused practice.
## Easy methods of Active Recall:
- Actual tests
- Self-quizzing
- Flashcards
- Summarizing reading/lecture from memory (no peeking!)
- Practicing problems with no notes,
- [Teaching the material to someone else](The%20Feynman%20Technique)
