Elaboration is when [learning is enhanced with "meaning-enhancing additions, constructions, or generations"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0361476X88900203).Information that's not connected with how you view the world will quickly slip away from your mind. On the other hand, a network of associations around new information will make it not only more memorable but also easier to apply in the future.

## Research-Based Principles of Elaboration
This is ripped directly from the article linked above.
### Should be meaningful and compatible with prior knowledge
Disconnected elaborations are less effective than meaningful ones. Also note that "meaningful" refers specifically to the context of the learner's mind; analogies that the learner doesn't comprehend will do them no good at all.
### Should integrate the to-be-associated information
Don't just come up with a sentence which mentions both new and old information, make sure they connect with each other. Describe how the new stuff affects the old stuff or vice versa.
### Should provide logical connections
The more the content is conceptually interconnected, the easier it is to remember, as the memory of one piece tugs on memories of the rest.
### Should prompt active information processing
An easy way to do this is to ask questions about the elaborative structure. This is especially helpful for learners who tend towards greater struggles with learning, as it may help walk their brains deeper encoding that others may do automatically.
### Should be vivid
Mostly applies to visual/imagery elaboration. Don't confuse vividness with bizarreness; bizarreness itself seems to have little impact on the effectiveness of elaboration.
### The more the better (sometimes)
If you provide more elaboration to an item, it is more likely to be remembered.
### It may sometimes be better for the instructor to provide elaborations
Some people have trouble generating their own elaborations, but they still benefit greatly from elaborations. For people who don't, it doesn't really matter whether the learner generates the elaboration on their own.
### [Verbal and Visual](Dual%20Coding%20Theory) elaborations are not always equivalent
Some topics and learners benefit more from verbal elaborations, while others are better off with visuals.
### Elaborations are beneficial for a vast variety of learners
While some learners benefit more than others, all benefit at least somewhat from elaboration, regardless of age, education level, etc.
### Elaborations do not benefit all performance outcomes
Elaborations are a tool for **memory.** They may not help with tasks that aren't so influenced by memory.
